# Operations_Research_Python

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts that explore
**operations research** topics.  Operations research is the discipline of
optimising complex systems and decision‑making using mathematical models.

## Focus areas

* **Inventory management** – models for determining optimal reorder
  quantities, safety stock and reorder points.
* **Linear programming** – formulating optimisation problems and solving
  them using simplex and interior‑point methods.
* **Other optimisation techniques** – potential extensions include
  integer programming, network flow problems and queuing models.

## Libraries used

* **PuLP** – a Python library for linear programming.  See
  <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/>.
* **SciPy** – provides optimisation routines such as `scipy.optimize.linprog`:
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html>
* **NumPy / pandas** – for data manipulation and numerical operations.
